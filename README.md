## The project
This is the homework assignment concluding the first 2 weeks from the boot camp. In this project I am acting as though I was hired by a social media marketing firm to assess and improve a web page that was created by another individual. Through code refactoring I was able to assess the HTML and CSS code and determine multiple changes that could be made all while preserving the initial layout and content of the web page. 

## Technologies applied
* HTML
* CSS

### Refactor:
    Multiple changes were made to the HTML as well as the CSS in order to make it reader friendly, professional, and streamlined. There were areas of code across both documents that included a lot of redundancies. These redundancies were resolved. The final production meets requirements set forth by the client.

### --All changes are noted within each document.--
